## Experimental Study on Emailing from Home Internet Connections

### Overview
- Led an experimental study under [Prof. Paul Pearce](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pearce/), focusing on the practical aspects of emailing from a home internet connection. Emphasized real-world application and user experience.

### Key Achievements
- **Significant Findings**: Achieved critical insights by selectively testing across **10 prominent mail servers**. This provided valuable data on email server performance and reliability in home internet environments.

### Practical Importance
Understanding the practical aspects of how to send emails from a residential Internet Service Provider (ISP) holds significant value, particularly in scenarios such as:

1. **Home-Based Businesses and Freelancers**: For individuals running a business from home, the ability to reliably send emails is crucial. Knowing how to navigate ISP restrictions ensures that their communication with clients and partners remains consistent and professional.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Using a residential ISP for sending emails can be more cost-effective than subscribing to commercial email services, especially for small-scale operations or personal use.
3. **Backup Communication System**: In cases where primary business email systems fail or are inaccessible, knowing how to configure and use a residential ISP for email can serve as a reliable backup.
4. **Advocacy and Policy Change**: Understanding the limitations and capabilities of residential ISPs in email sending can inform discussions and advocacy around internet policies, potentially leading to more user-friendly and flexible ISP practices.
5. **Customization and Control**: Setting up your own email sending system allows for greater customization and control over your email environment, which can be important for specific technical or privacy needs.

### Comic Strip: Understanding the Concept
To help visualize and simplify the study's concept, we've created a comic strip. It walks through the challenges and solutions of using a residential ISP for email in a fun and engaging way.
